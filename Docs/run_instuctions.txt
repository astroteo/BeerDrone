==============================================RUN THE FULL SIMULATION
1. open matlab ( $matlab )
   locate the matlab path to be  Documents/lufo-RTAPHM-OS-simulator/matlab [see the image Docs/imgs/matlab_path_set.png]
   click on the folder 'lib_files' and do 'add to path' -> selected folders and subfolders [see image in Docs/imgs/AddLibsToMatlab.png]
   ensure that the variables are set as follow in main.m file: 
	gazebo_connect = 1;% 
	gazebo_connect_debug_mode = 0

   run the main script
   open the file PusherPropellerPowerDriveGazeboConnected.slx but, !! DO NOT RUN IT YET!!

2. Launch the flight simulator: 

(ensure to be in the root of the project, e.g. cd  Documents/lufo-RTAPHM-OS-simulator)

./launch.sh VTOL

3. run the simulink simulation
	
  press play on simulink.


4. command a mission to the virtual A/C 
	4a. remove previous flight plan 
	4b. create a new flight plan ( select takeoff, confirm VTOL transition, add a bunch of waypoints) 
	4c. upload the waypoints
	4d. command the flight!

5. plot results 

in matlab run the script plot_datasim.m 

===== IMPORTANT NOTES: 

if the Simulnink simulation is not started, a "transition-timeout" will be triggered and the A/C will automatically return to the 


==============================================RUN ONLY THE MATLAB SIMULATOR: 

1. open matlab ( $matlab )
   locate the matlab path to be  Documents/lufo-RTAPHM-OS-simulator/matlab [see the image Docs/imgs/matlab_path_set.png]
   click on the foldes and do 'add to path' -> selected folders and subfolders [see image add in Docs/imgs/AddLibsToMatlab.png]
   ensure that the variables are set as follow in main.m: 
	gazebo_connect = 0;
	gazebo_connect_debug_mode = 1

   the python script send_UDPDUmmy.py ensures that the simulation do not crash 

 

==============================================RUN IN DEBUG MODE:
1. open matlab ( $matlab )
   locate the matlab path to be  Documents/lufo-RTAPHM-OS-simulator/matlab [see the image Docs/imgs/matlab_path_set.png]
   click on the folder 'lib_files' and do 'add to path' -> selected folders and subfolders [see image in Docs/imgs/AddLibsToMatlab.png]
   ensure that the variables are set as follow in main.m file: 
	gazebo_connect = 1;% 
	gazebo_connect_debug_mode = 0

   run the main script
   open the file PusherPropellerPowerDriveGazeboConnected.slx but, !! DO NOT RUN IT YET!!

2. locate yourself in the LuFO-plugins folder
	./test_gazebo_plugins.sh


this launches a fake A/C but no mission is commanded! 


==============================================TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. sudo issues on matlab side: I messed up by launching matlab as sudo ( e.g.$sudo matlab instead of $matlab) if this is the case please copy-paste all the matlab files in a folder not linked to the git repository and launch these files instead of the original ones. Moreover ensure that read-write access to all matlab files (*.m, *mat, *.slx)
